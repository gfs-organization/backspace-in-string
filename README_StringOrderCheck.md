## String Order Check

For any given String, return a new String with all the characters in ASCII order, or return "in order" if the String's
characters are already in order.

### Hints:

- Write test cases to prove your results.
- Don't forget edge cases.
- Go for speed. Efficiency will improve your score. Time your test runs.

#### Examples:

- Input: "abcdefg" ==> Output: "in order"
- Input: "zyxwvu" ==> Output: "uvwxyz"
- Input: "I'm not in order!" ==> Output: ""
